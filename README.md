# Automatic-Attendance-Marking-Using-Facial-Recognition-Technique
Attendance marking in a classroom can be a tedious and time-consuming task,  especially when dealing with many students. Marking attendance by following  traditional methods have been known to lack reliability

The proposed system utilizes facial recognition technology to automate the process of attendance marking, resulting in a reduction of workload for educators compared to traditional methods. The implemented software-based attendance system for any 
organisation lowers the hardware cost, which is a great accomplishment and greatly benefits society. This is more affordable and practical than any other biometric system.The entire system is automated and hence no additional staff is required to monitor the attendance procedure.Not only the implemented system lowers the cost but increases operational efficiency. Since time plays an important factor in any organisation, the project aims at preventing time loss and providing it for other productive purposes. Manual attendance system can be prone to human errors , as in case of institutes there are many cases of pseudo attendance commonly called ‘proxy.’ A refined version of the project will deliver satisfactory accuracy with minimal errors.The traditional methods 
of attendance marking is time-consuming, need additional staff. Moreover, the data can easily be manipulated.

## Software Requirements
● The project will use the Python programming language.
● Advanced Python Classifiers like OpenCV will be used to detect the face of the student in front of the camera.
● The software must be capable of marking the attendance of the student based on the detected face.
● The software must feature a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to display the attendance being recorded.
● The GUI should display attendance in real-time as the software detects the student's face.
● The attendance will be stored in an Excel sheet for further analysis and record keeping.
● The software should be able to detect multiple faces simultaneously in a crowded environment.
● The software should be able to operate in different lighting conditions and camera angles.
● The accuracy and reliability of the software must be tested and validated.
● The software should be user-friendly and easy to use for teachers and administrative staff

## System Design
The project will include separate modules for face detection, face recognition, and attendance recording.
To detect faces, the project will use advanced Python classifiers such as OpenCV and process the video feed in real time.
The face recognition module will use machine learning algorithms to match the detected faces with the images of registered students in a database.
The attendance recording module will keep track of attendance in real time and store the data in an Excel sheet, which can be accessed and modified as required.
The project will have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to display attendance records, real-time updates, and any error messages.
The GUI will be designed using a framework such as PyQt or Tkinter and will provide a user-friendly interface for teachers and administrative staff.
The project will include a database to store the registered student's details and images.
The project will incorporate error-handling modules to deal with potential issues, such as network failure, camera failure, or low lighting conditions.
The system will be designed to work with a single camera for starters and then it will be extended with multiple cameras, and attendance records from all cameras will be stored in a centralized database.
The project will include measures to ensure data privacy and security, such as password-protected access to the database.
